| _,.-'``'-.,_,.'`` Step 1 ``'.,_,.-'``'-.,_|Screenshot|
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |- |
<b><u><i>Defining the problem:</i></u></b><br>As a German teacher in Brazil, quite often I have<br>to read texts about philosophy, politics, medicine etc. with my<br>students.  Nowadays, the PDF format is the most common file format to<br>share text because of its simplicity.  <br><br><u><b>As a German teacher, I distinguish between 3 types of PDFs:</b></u>  <br><br>1) The <b>“text-is-text-format”</b>:<br>The text we see is a real text (for the computer). We can copy and<br>paste it and search through it using CTRL + F. If all PDFs were like<br>this, my tool wouldn’t be necessary.   <br><br>2) The <b>“text-is-picture-with-a-text-overlay-format”</b>: The text we are reading is actually a picture,<br>but there is a text layer on top of it. Sometimes that works so great that we can’t even notice a difference to the  “text-is-text-format”,<br>but many times we end up getting results like you can see on the right<br>picture when we use CTRL + C !   <br><br>3) The <b>“text-is-picture-format”</b>: For<br>us humans, it is a text but for the computer it is a picture, there<br>are no additional text layers. We can neither copy the text nor can we<br>use CTRL + F to search through it.|<img src="images/33_800x800.png" width="400"/> |

| _,.-'``'-.,_,.'`` Step 2 ``'.,_,.-'``'-.,_|Screenshot|
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |- |
<b><u><i>Why PDFImage2TXT?</i></u></b><br>There are some tools around to solve this problem, but I haven’t found<br>any which use [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR). EasyOCR is made by some Indian company and<br>produces the greatest results ever! It is incredible how good it is!<br>It is far better than everything that I have seen so far, even better<br>than Googles [Tesseract](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract)! The only problem is that it is really slow,<br>but <b>I rather wait longer for great results than having shxxxy results right away.</b> <br>The only thing I needed to make EasyOcr work the way I<br>wanted to, was a way to convert the PDF file to images. After searching for about 5 minutes on [GitHub](https://github.com/), I found a nice tool to convert each page of a PDF<br>to a jpg file of good quality (300 DPI). Since  [pdf2jpg](https://github.com/pankajr141/pdf2jpg) <br> uses [Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html), please ensure that<br>[Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) is installed on your system! If it is not installed, PDFImage2TXT<br>won’t work on your PC!|<img src="images/66_800x800.png" width="400"/> |

| _,.-'``'-.,_,.'`` Step 3 ``'.,_,.-'``'-.,_|Screenshot|
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |- |
<b><u><i>How to use it?</i></u></b><br><b>PDFImage2TXT is very simple to use:</b><br>1) Install it <br>2) Start it<br>3) Select the PDF or image you want to convert<br>4) If you convert a PDF file, you can decide what pages you want to convert to text:<br> <br><b>if you write <u>11,12,13,14,15</u> after having selected the PDF, the app will only convert the pages 11,12,13,14,15!</b><br>If you write <b>"ALL"</b>, the app will convert the whole PDF document to text!<br><br>5) If you convert a picture to text, there is nothing else to configure.|<img src="images/99_800x800.png" width="400"/> |

| _,.-'``'-.,_,.'`` Step 4 ``'.,_,.-'``'-.,_|Screenshot|
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |- |
<b><u><i>Behind the scenes:</i></u></b><br>You don't have to choose a name for the output folder or file! During the<br>process, a folder with the same name as your PDF + the ending <b>"_dir"</b><br>will be created, and <b>special characters in the name of the folder </b> will be<br>replaced by underlines.  <br><br><i>(Example: Jürgen Habermas - Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit  -Suhrkamp (2001).pdf <b>becomes</b> J_rgen_Habermas_Strukturwandel_der_ffentlichkeit_Suhrkamp_2001_pdf_dir)</i><br><br> <b><u> <i>Please make sure that there isn’t already a folder with that name!</i></u></b><br>  Inside the folder, there will be <b>2 files for each page</b>: one <b>JPG</b> and one <b>TXT</b>|<img src="images/132_800x800.png" width="400"/> |

| _,.-'``'-.,_,.'`` Step 5 ``'.,_,.-'``'-.,_|Screenshot|
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |- |
Once the entire process is done, PDFImage2TXT will create a single TXT file by joining all TXT files<br> <b>The final TXT file will be in the same folder and will contain the prefix "complete"!</b><br> <b><u>Everything that you want is in that file! You only need that file!</u></b><br> If you want, you can delete everything else!|<img src="images/165_800x800.png" width="400"/> |

| _,.-'``'-.,_,.'`` Step 6 ``'.,_,.-'``'-.,_|Screenshot|
| -------------------------------------------------------------- |- |
As you can see, <b>thanks to EasyOcr the results are almost perfect!</b> <br><b><u>The script I wrote, takes care of the hyphens at the end of each line. It<br>makes sure that all separated words are not separated in the converted<br>document!</u></b>  PDFImage2TXT took about <b>1h15m</b> for a PDF with around<br><b>1,000,000 characters</b>. I used an Intel i5-9600KF @ 3.7 GHz with 6<br>Cores. <i>It should be a lot faster with CUDA enabled (for everybody with<br>an NVIDIA GPU), but I couldn't get it to run on my PC. I am able to<br>use Cupy, OpenCV and Spacy with CUDA, but not Easy OCR.  If you have<br>any solution, please tell me/us! It would be nice to implement that<br>feature!</i>|<img src="images/198_800x800.png" width="400"/> |

## Donations 

If this project has helped you somehow, consider donating a small amount. After being absent from computer programming for more than 20 years, I started again this year. At the beginning of 2021, I suffered from a bone infection and had to spend more than 3 months in hospital (only laying in bed!). To kill time, I stared learning Python, which rapidly became something bigger for me than just a "time killer".
